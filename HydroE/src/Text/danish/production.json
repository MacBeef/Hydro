Our yachts contribute to a more sustainable\nfuture without compromising on performance, quality or comfort. When sailing with Vaan, we want to\nensure the only footprint you leave is the one on the beach, says Igor Kluin, co-founder and CEO of Vaan Yachts.\n\nAluminium can be remelted infinitely without loss of the properties that\nmake it ideal for marine applications, lightness, rigidness and corrosion resistance.\nEach Vaan yacht contains 6,000-10,000 kg of aluminium originating from Hydro, both rolled\nsheet and extrusions. Hydro's low-carbon aluminium comes with a proof of origin that provides\nboth batch traceability and a documented carbon footprint."
